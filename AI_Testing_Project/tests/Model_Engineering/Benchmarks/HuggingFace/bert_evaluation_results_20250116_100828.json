      "generated": "Camels can survive for long periods without water due to several unique physiological adaptations:\n\n1. Water storage: While they don't store water in their humps (which actually contain fat), camels can drink large amounts of water (up to 30 gallons) in a short time and store it in their bloodstream.\n\n2. Water conservation:\n- Their kidneys and liver can efficiently process and conserve water\n- They produce concentrated urine and dry feces to minimize water loss\n- They can tolerate high body temperatures, reducing the need for cooling through sweating\n\n3. Blood cells:\n- Oval-shaped blood cells that can continue flowing even when dehydrated\n- Can handle large changes in water content without rupturing\n\n4. Body temperature regulation:\n- Can allow their body temperature to fluctuate from 93\u00b0F to 107\u00b0F\n- Only start sweating at higher temperatures than most mammals\n\n5. Fat storage:\n- Their humps store fat, which can be metabolized for both energy and water\n- When fat is metabolized, it produces water as a byproduct\n\n6. Efficient nostrils:\n- Can trap water vapor from exhaled air and return it to their body\n\nThese adaptations allow camels to survive up to a week without water in hot conditions and even longer in cooler weather.",
