      "reference": "Photosynthesis is the process plants use to convert sunlight into energy. Plants capture sunlight using chlorophyll in their leaves, then combine this solar energy with water from the soil and carbon dioxide from the air. Through this process, they produce glucose for energy and release oxygen as a byproduct. This glucose provides food for the plant's growth and survival, while the oxygen released is essential for most life on Earth. The process is crucial for maintaining Earth's ecosystem and forms the basis of most food chains.",
      "prediction": "Photosynthesis is how plants make their own food using sunlight. Here's the simple breakdown:\n\n1. Plants take in sunlight through their leaves\n2. They absorb water through their roots\n3. They take in carbon dioxide from the air through tiny holes in their leaves\n4. Using these ingredients (sunlight, water, and carbon dioxide), plants create glucose (sugar) for food\n5.

The immediate cause was the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria-Hungary in 1914, but deeper causes included nationalism, militarism, and complex alliance systems in Europe. Imperial rivalry between European powers led to arms races and colonial competition. The system of secret alliances divided Europe into opposing camps: the Triple Alliance of Germany, Austria-Hungary, and Italy, versus the Triple Entente of Britain, France, and Russia. Growing nationalism, especially in the Balkans, created tensions between ethnic groups and empires. These factors combined to turn a local conflict into a global war.",

      "reference": "Cloud formation begins when water vapor in the atmosphere rises and cools through various processes like convection or frontal lifting. As the air cools to its dew point, the water vapor condenses around tiny particles called condensation nuclei, forming water droplets or ice crystals. These droplets collect and grow larger, forming clouds. Different types of clouds form at various altitudes and under different conditions. Precipitation occurs when these droplets become too heavy to remain suspended. The type of precipitation (rain, snow, sleet, or hail) depends on atmospheric conditions like temperature and humidity.

Evaporation\n- Water from surfaces (oceans, lakes, soil) heats up and turns into water vapor\n- Warm air containing water vapor rises due to being lighter than cool air\n\n2. Rising Air\n- As air rises, it encounters lower atmospheric pressure\n- The air expands and cools (adiabatic cooling)\n\n3.
