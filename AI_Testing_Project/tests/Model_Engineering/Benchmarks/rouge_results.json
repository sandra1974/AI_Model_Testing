Neurons process inputs using:\n   - Sum of weighted inputs\n   - Activation function\n4. Information flows through layers\n5. Output layer provides results\n\nLearning occurs through:\n- Adjusting weights\n- Backpropagation\n- Training with examples\n- Error correction\n\nApplications include:\n- Image recognition\n- Speech processing\n- Pattern detection\n- Decision making\n\nThink of it like a brain learning from experience and adjusting its understanding accordingly.",
